# Day-Planner

User opens page and there is a header that states it's a planner and has teh current day and date

There will be 9 rows in the lower area containing a big input area that will have times 9-5 with a button to the right that states "save"

input element times values/class/input compared to the current time and assigned a different color based on if it's in the past, current or future hour

when user clicks save, the value of the corresponding input box will be saved and value won't be cleared so it'll stay in box.  Time class/id/value of that input box will also be saved.

when save is clicked, local storage will store the value of the input box and the time
